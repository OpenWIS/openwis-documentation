The [Checklist](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis/projects/1) is a project on GitHub.  Please update the status of your tasks as you do them by:
  - Opening your assigned issues and adding comments to describe progress and problems.
  - Moving your issues right on the board as they move from _pending_ to _published_ (drag n drop).
