Each contributing individual within a contributing organisation must personally sign the CLA form.</p>

<h2 id="1-definitions">1. Definitions</h2>

<p>“<strong>You</strong>” (or “<strong>Your</strong>”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the OpenWIS Association AISBL. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this definition, “<strong>control</strong>” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

<p>“<strong>Contribution</strong>” shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the OpenWIS Association AISBL for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the OpenWIS Association AISBL (the “<strong>Work</strong>”).  For the purposes of this definition, “<strong>submitted</strong>” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the OpenWIS Association AISBL or its representatives or members, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the OpenWIS Association for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “<strong>Not a Contribution</strong>”.</p>

<p>“<strong>OpenWIS Association AISBL</strong>” shall mean the OpenWIS Association Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif, a not-for-profit association established under the laws of the Kingdom of Belgium with its registered office at Ringlaan 3, Avenue Circulaire, B-1180, Brussels, Belgium.</p>

<h2 id="2-grant-of-copyright-license">2. Grant of copyright license</h2>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the OpenWIS Association AISBL and to recipients of software distributed by the OpenWIS Association AISBL a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works under the terms of the license specified for the OpenWIS® Project to which a Contribution is submitted. Details of the license specified for each OpenWIS® Project shall be located in the LICENSE file of the project’s repository within the <a href="https://github.com/openwis">OpenWIS GitHub organization</a>. As stated in <a href="/openwis-documentation/rules/9-software-licensing.html#rule-9.1">Rule 9.1</a> of the <a href="/openwis-documentation/rules/">Internal Rules</a> of the OpenWIS Association AISBL, the license chosen for an OpenWIS® Project shall be one of the open source licenses from the list maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) at: <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">https://opensource.org/licenses/</a>.</p>

<p>You agree and acknowledge that the OpenWIS Association AISBL and its licensees may sublicense and distribute your Contributions under any subsequent version of the license specified for the OpenWIS® Project to which your Contribution was made. Furthermore, You agree that, by approval of the <a href="/openwis-documentation/structure/steering-committee.html">OpenWIS Steering Committee</a>, an OpenWIS® Project may change the license (and this CLA) from time to time to an alternative open source license from the list maintained by the OSI in order to suit the evolution of the Project.  A <a href="/openwis-documentation/static/CLA/CLAhistory.html">history of approved CLAs</a> is available.</p>

<h2 id="3-intellectual-property-infringement">3. Intellectual property infringement</h2>

<p>If any third party makes any claim against You or any other entity, alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, infringes the intellectual property rights of that third party, then You shall inform the OpenWIS Association AISBL within five (5) Working Days of such claim in order for the OpenWIS Association AISBL to take all appropriate action it deems necessary in relation to the claim.</p>

<h2 id="4-legal-entitlement">4. Legal entitlement</h2>

<p>You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the OpenWIS Association AISBL.</p>

<h2 id="5-contribution-of-your-creations">5. Contribution of Your creation(s)</h2>

<p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and that you have not assigned or otherwise given up your interest in the Contribution to any third party (see <a href="#6-contribution-of-creation-on-behalf-of-third-party">Clause 6</a> for submissions on behalf of others).  You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party licence or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.</p>

<h2 id="6-contribution-of-creation-on-behalf-of-third-party">6. Contribution of creation(s) on behalf of a third-party</h2>

<p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the OpenWIS Association AISBL separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: Third Party Name <strong>__</strong>__”.</p>

<p>When appropriate, details of source, license, other restrictions and the identification that the submission is provided on behalf of a named third-party may be included within the Pull Request associated with the submission of work that is not Your original creation.</p>

<h2 id="7-notification">7. Notification</h2>

<p>You agree to notify the OpenWIS Association AISBL of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect. You further agree to fully indemnify, and keep indemnified, the OpenWIS Association AISBL against any losses suffered as a result of any fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation made by you under Clauses <a href="#4-legal-entitlement">4</a>, <a href="#5-contribution-of-your-creations">5</a> or <a href="#6-contribution-of-creation-on-behalf-of-third-party">6</a>.</p>

<h2 id="8-dispute-resolution">8. Dispute resolution</h2>

<p>The Parties shall attempt in good faith to negotiate a settlement to any dispute arising between them out of or in connection with this Agreement within 30 Working Days of the dispute arising.</p>

<p>If the dispute cannot be resolved, then the Parties shall attempt to settle it by mediation in accordance with the Belgian Centre for Arbitration and Mediation (“EPANI”) Model Mediation Procedure from time-to-time in force.</p>

<p>To initiate the mediation a party to the Agreement must give notice in writing (the “ADR Notice”) to the other party requesting mediation in accordance with this clause.</p>

<h2 id="9-mediation">9. Mediation</h2>

<p>The mediation is to take place not later than 30 Working Days after the ADR Notice. If there is any issue on the conduct of the mediation upon which the Parties cannot agree within 14 Working Days of the ADR Notice, then EPANI shall, at the request of either party, decide the issue for the Parties, having consulted with them.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed, all negotiations connected with the dispute and any settlement shall be conducted in confidence and without prejudice to the rights of the Parties in any future proceedings.</p>

<p>If the Parties reach agreement on the resolution of the dispute, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall be binding on the Parties once it is signed by both You and the OpenWIS Association AISBL.</p>

<p>If the Parties fail to reach agreement within 60 Working Days of the initiation of the mediation, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties, then any dispute or difference between them may be referred to the courts.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Agreement affects the right of You or the OpenWIS Association AISBL to apply to the court for urgent interim equitable relief (including, but not limited to, an injunction).</p>

<h2 id="10-policies-procedures">10. Policies and procedures</h2>

<p>Any person or organization wishing to Contribute to an OpenWIS® Project shall abide by the <a href="/openwis-documentation/rules/">Internal Rules</a>, <a href="/openwis-documentation/tr/">Technical Rules</a> and <a href="/openwis-documentation/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> of the OpenWIS Association AISBL and the policies and procedures defined by the <a href="/openwis-documentation/structure/steering-committee.html">OpenWIS Steering Committee</a>, including the <a href="/openwis-documentation/static/CLA/CLAprocess.html">process used to manage the CLA</a>.</p>
