<h2 id="rule-6.5">Rule 6.5</h2>

<p>It is anticipated that the fees set out in <a href="#rule-6.3">Rule 6.3</a> shall be sufficient to meet the running costs of the Association (as anticipated by <a href="/governance/articles/10-membership-contributions-subscriptions-fees-and-additional-finance.html#article-10.1">Article 10.1</a> of the <a href="/governance/articles/">Articles of Association</a>). In the event that additional finance is required during the course of any year, this shall be sought according to the procedure set out in <a href="/governance/articles/10-membership-contributions-subscriptions-fees-and-additional-finance.html">Article 10</a> of the <a href="/governance/articles/">Articles of Association</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rule-6.6">Rule 6.6</h2>

<p>Calls for additional finance under <a href="#rule-6.5">Rule 6.5</a> and Article 10 of the <a href="/governance/articles/">Articles of Association</a> shall not affect the right of the Board to adjust membership fees for the following year in accordance with <a href="#rule-6.2">Rule 6.2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rule-6.7">Rule 6.7</h2>

<p>Members and Partners hold the following obligations towards the Association:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To promptly appoint Representatives and Delegates to represent them at meetings of the Association, where required to do so;</li>
  <li>To promptly notify the Association of any change in the identity of their Representative and/or Delegate;</li>
  <li>To engage constructively in and make a positive contribution to all meetings and other activities of the Association;</li>
  <li>To engage with and promptly carry out their obligations under the Strategic Programme and Work Plans produced by the Association;</li>
  <li>To ensure that relevant information concerning the activities of the Association is circulated throughout the Member or Partner’s organisation, as appropriate; and</li>
  <li>To pay all fees, subscriptions and contributions due to the Association promptly and in full.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rule-6.8">Rule 6.8</h2>

<p>Amounts due to the Association must be paid within 30 days of becoming due. In accordance with the Belgian Late Payment Law, interest on amounts overdue by more than 30 days will be charged at 8 percentage points on top of the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its most recent main refinancing operation, rounded up to the higher half percentage point.</p>
