A-OWIS-SC-2016-5 PR - Do some more detailed tasking around production of docs for open source (licence etc?).

### DevCon 2016 update

At the DevCon it was decided (subject to TC and SC approval) that we will go open source with v 3.14.

The following tasks were then agreed:

  - 75.1 v3 - 3.14 Deployment guide
  - 75.2 v3 - 3.14 Deployment package
  - 76.1 v3 - CLA (complete, review, publish)
  - 76.2 v3 - Technical rules (draft, review, publish)
  - 76.3 v3 - Code of Conduct (draft, review, publish)
  - 78 v3 - Website improvements
  - 190 v3 - Update OpenWIS poster
  
PR - I will add/update these tasks on the Kanban and add the subtasks as GitHub projects.
