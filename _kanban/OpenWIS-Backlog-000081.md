Refactoring to improve the modularity of the system architecture. LM - Important but needs to be done with care to avoid a blowout of complexity. Est. just a guess as I'm not sure of the scope of this work.

PR - The initial scope should at least improve the way OpenWIS code interfaces with GeoNetwork code.

GT is documenting his investigation of the options here (https://github.com/NMichas/openwis-draft-analysis/wiki/Enhancing-GeoNetwork-UI)
