Adopt the odd/even release number system.  So ODD=development release; EVEN=production release.  The middle digit of the fully qualified 3 digit release number is the digit that is odd or even.

Examples of Odd/development release numbers would be:

- 4.1.0
- 4.1.2
- 5.1.6

Examples of Even/production release numbers would be:

- 4.2.0
- 4.2.1
- 5.0.3

So, just as an example, a development cycle might go:

- 4.0.1 not released
- 4.0.2 not released
- 4.1.0 development release
- 4.1.1 not released
- 4.1.2 not released
- 4.1.3 not released
- 4.2.0 production release
- 4.2.1 production patch release.
