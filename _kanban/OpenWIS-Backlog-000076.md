Publish collaborative development policies and procedures on website. LM - See above: need a functioning website first

### Dev Con 2016 update

The main things missing from the website are:

  - a completed Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA - an annex to the Internal Rules)
  - the Technical Rules
  - a Code of Conduct

NWS are improving the website as part of Kanban item 78, so the tasks here relate to creating the text for the above.  Initially we will focus on the CLA and Technical Rules:

  - PR will complete the CLA annex to the Internal Rules, but with a written CLA rather than an electronic CLA, at this early stage.  PR will circulate a draft for review by the TC/SC and legal depts of each Association partner.
  - LM will draft the Technical Rules and circulate to the TC/SC for review.
  - Once we have those we will consider what we need in terms of a Code of Conduct by looking at what other FOSS organisations do.

The objective is to complete this work as soon as possible, but not necessarily before the (low-key) open source announcement at CBS 2016, because we are not expecting a sudden great interest in contributing to OpenWIS initially.
