Update - 2017-02-22 DW: GeoNetwork 3 pulls various fields out of the metadata and assigns them to categories,
 which it then offers as search filters in the UI.  We should figure out how that works and then decide how we can best exploit that capability.

This topic will be covered by Dom's presentation in Toulouse 2017.
