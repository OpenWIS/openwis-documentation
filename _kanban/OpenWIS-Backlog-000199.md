Update - 2017-02-22 DW: Until the WIS metadata model changes, we still need flat metadata that we can share with other non-OpenWIS GISCs.
However, it may still be worth having internal parent/child relationships for internal management of the metadata,
so we could investigate what facilities GeoNetwork 3 gives us to do this out of the box.

This topic will be covered by Dom's presentation in Toulouse 2017.
