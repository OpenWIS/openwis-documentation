#### Notes (provided with the agenda)
- I assume that there is no desire to amend the Articles of Association? (Article A20.1 refers) - see that amendments to Internal Rules are covered in item (11).
- For item (5) 'OpenWIS Association Membership' we should look at [recommendations from the SC for] Admission of new Members (see Article A6; "Requires unanimous decision of the Board that the corporate purpose of the candidate Member should be compatible with the purpose of the Organization"). I am assuming that you have not received any written notification from Members indicating their intent to resign? (see Article A7; "Requires notification in writing to be made to the Chairperson of the Board at least six-months prior to 31-Dec"). Finally, any calls for exclusion of a Member (see Article A8 and Rules R4.11 and R4.12) could be covered in AOB (?) - but I've not heard of such concerns being raised. Either way, exclusion requires unanimous decision of the Representatives present.
- For item (6) 'OpenWIS Association Partnership', Article A9.3 indicates that new Partners must be recommended to the Board by the SC
- For item (8) 'Annual accounts' "The proper expenses of the Association include any costs associated with the achievement of its purpose (as set out in Article 2 of the Articles of Association), but do not include: (i) Costs of any staff employed by a Member or Partner (except for the OpenWIS Community Manager); (ii) Travel and subsistence costs incurred by a Member or Partner, or any member of staff employed by them (including the costs of attending meetings of the association); (iii) Costs of arranging or hosting meetings on he premises of any Member or Partner; or (iv) Costs associated with the operational use of the OpenWIS software by any Member or Partner." (Rule R10.3).
- For item (11) 'Approval of changes to Internal Rules', note that "New versions of these Internal Rules shall be provided to Members and Partners of the Association as soon as reasonably practicable after their adoption by the Board. New versions shall come into effect 30 days after their adoption." (Rule R11.4).
- For item (11.1) 'Financial controls' we should decide whether to amend Rule R10.3 (ii) which states that "[proper expenses of the Association do not include] Travel and subsistence costs incurred by a Member or Partner, or any member of staff employed by them (including the costs of attending meetings of the association)" - what about Technical Lead attendance at Developer Convention? In 2015, OpenWIS Association covered Leon's T&S to attend the DevCon hosted by Met Office.


#### Notes regarding operation of Annual Meeting (from review of Articles of Association and Internal Rules):
- (A12.3) "The Organization shall in each calendar year hold at least one Board Meeting (the "Annual Meeting") […] and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it."
- (A12.11) "Except where these Articles of Association expressly require any matter to be decided unanimously, or by a simple majority, motions raised at a Board Meeting shall be carried by a three-quarters majority. Each Member has one vote." 
- (A12.15) "A Representative may represent up to one (1) other Member, besides the Member which appointed him or her, at a Board Meeting. A written proxy, signed by the Member giving the proxy, shall be required for that purpose. The represented Member(s) shall then be considered as present."
- (A12.16) "A meeting of the Board shall be quorate if at least three-quarters of the Members are present. Representatives may be assisted by advisers at meetings of the Board."
- (A12.18) "Resolutions of the Annual Meeting […] shall be recorded in writing and be open to all Members for inspection."
- (R8.3) "[...] The notice [of calling an Annual Meeting, issued no later than 31-days prior to the date of the Annual Meeting] should also be accompanied by a provisional agenda. Should any Representative wish to add an item to the agenda, that Representative should inform the Chairperson of the Board [...] at least three weeks before the Annual Meeting."
- (R8.8) "Documentation and information relating to items on an agenda [of a Board Meeting] shall be circulated amongst the Representatives or Delegates in advance of any meeting and should allow sufficient time to allow the Members and Partners an opportunity to consider them. In accordance with Article 15.2 of the Articles of Association, the Annual Accounts must be communicated to Members not less than 30 days before the Annual Meeting."

Hi Jeremy,

As agreed, here are all the places we mentioned governance procedures in the meetings.    This meeting is to sense check and distil this list and then agree what actions or agenda items flow from this.

Cheers,
Paul


TC Seoul Mar 2016

Work through proposals for how roles and governance will work in OpenWIS 4 for accessing / editing (meta)data (we plan to adopt the GeoNetwork methods); can we infer roles from data policy (e.g. WMO Essential); is there a need to harmonise the Groups in GISCs (roles are assigned to a particular Group for a given metadata record)
1.    JT - displayed the GeoNetwork manual - the pages on Users, Groups, Roles
2.    JT - What Groups should we define?
3.    WQ - GeoNetwork looks like it has a detailed enough process for what OpenWIS does. How does this help implement Data Policy?
4.    JT - you can implement WMO Essential - no access controls - not anything else. Not sure we have a good way of implementing Data Policy. This is a part of migration to OpenWIS 4 that still needs further thought.
5.    WQ - how would GeoNetwork expose these privileges etc to OpenWIS?
6.    JT - GeoNetwork decides based on permissions whether to show you the buttons for the related actions.
7.    RGb - we should investigate how to link the data policy in the metadata with the assignment of GeoNetwork privileges - but maybe too complicated.
8.    ACTION-TC-2016-21: RGb - Investigate how to link the data policy in the metadata with the assignment of GeoNetwork privileges.
9.    RGr - We also have a problem syncing access privileges between GISCs or even agreeing a common understanding of roles between GISCs.
10.  ACTION-TC-2016-22: RGr - Create a work package to review Data Policy and Access Control implications in detail.

Documentations - for user, developer, administrator (how we manage the documents, in what form, where etc)
1.    JT - so our decision last time was to use Github, Markdown, Jekyll, html.
2.    MV - should someone be responsible for the docs?
3.    JT - Yes, the developers, it’s not part of the Community Mgr role.
4.    PR - set up a Markdown to html conversion/publication process - see Richard Hattersley in the UKMO AVD team.
5.    ACTION-TC-2016-26: PR - Investigate/arrange a Markdown to html publication process.
6.    WQ - where should the docs be published?
7.    JT - on Github and the openwis.io website.
8.    WQ - is any retrospective work needed to convert existing docs to Markdown?
9.    JT/MGo - yes, it needs a task.
10. WQ - do we want to say what docs we need?
11. JT - initially, docs to onboard new developers such as at KMA, NWS.
12. JT - for open source we will need a code of conduct/ethics for new developers - don’t start from scratch - use another open source project as a template.
13. JT - we need to write down our development process - understand all the roles and responsibilities we are giving to people - doc manager, release manager, contributors, etc and how you get to be one of these roles.
14. JT - we need a project website that describes the OpenWIS software, status of the build, status of the project, Kanban board, work packages etc.
15. MGo - we will also need a style guide for pages, code etc
16. BB - you also need project communications and governance - SC/TC etc.
17. JT - yes we should publish the meeting details for TC/SC, agendas, minutes, how you join in.
18. BB - contributors, IP holders, issue trackers, licences…
19. JT - also, to help people spin up, we would provide other resources eg: Eclipse tool for project - publish it on our website. Needed for ourselves as well as the open source project.
20. WQ - what do we need to do now?
21. JT - at a minimum translate into markdown.
22. WQ - install guide?
23. JT - should the OpenWIS Association budget for a technical author to make a start on this? We have content but need templates, style sheets etc.
24. WQ - we should.
25. JT - we could get the OpenWIS Association to buy that resource in for say 20 days. Cost about GBP400/day?
26. MGo - do we include architecture/design docs?
27. JT - they might be better on the wiki.
28. WQ - Ok, agreed - recommend to SC - for about 10k euro. Aim to deliver June 2016.
29. Recommendation 2: Hire a technical author to establish an initial guide and style. Budget about 10k Euro. Aim to deliver by end of June 2016.

SC Seoul Mar 2016

1.    MDA – Regarding the tenure - 1 year seems too short – should we change to 2 years?
2.    RGir – That is defined in the articles of Association, so we would need to ask the King of Belgium! However, the version of the articles published by the notaries was corrupted in the PDF. I have asked the notaries what to do and am awaiting an answer. Maybe we could include this rule change if we have to republish?
3.    JT – It doesn’t seem right to change the meaning in that way.
4.    MDA – I agree, we will need to change them at some time for other reasons and should leave it until then.
5.    JT - Where articles are unclear the internal rules clarify.
6.    MDA - So in the internal rules we could say that by default the tenure is 2 years and that re-election is routine unless others want to stand?
7.    RESOLUTION-SC-2016-01:Resolution: vote: 7-0 in favour - Amend Internal Rules to say that default tenure is 2 years unless others want to stand for election.

JT paper on multiple projects
1.    ACTION-SC-2016-11: JT - Publish Articles, Internal Rules and Board etc on our website.
2.    OL - Is it not possible to have multiple projects without changing the internal rules?
3.    JT/WQ - The internal rules are not clear about how we run projects. This needs to be clear to ourselves and for others.
4.    RGir - In French we have singular software rather than plural software(s), so it is explicitly singular.
5.    JT - So we may need to clarify this in the articles in the future.
6.    ACTION-SC-2016-12: JT - Make sure the role of User is clear in the internal rules.
7.    OL - As soon as we change the internal rules, does the OpenWIS software become a project?
8.    JT - Yes.
9.    WQ – Does it cover removing PMC members?
10.  JT - The process needs to cover that, probably escalated to SC for a decision.
11.  BB - How are Contributors tied in with articles?
12.  JT - They are not because they are not partners or members. We need to say they comply with the Code of Conduct, which we need to write down.
13.  ACTION-SC-2016-13: JT (through Michael Robbins) get legal advice on whether the articles shelter the contributors from litigation.
14.  WQ – Is the PMC subordinate to the SC or the TC?
15.  (JT captured a discussion about the roles of Technical Committee/Steering Committee/Project Management Committee, in real-time, in a diagram on-screen. The meeting finally agreed this Committee Role Structure)
16.  JT – Ok, so we agree that the TC will continue to operate as PMC for OpenWIS Core for the time being so that the articles don’t have to be changed.
17.  ACTION-SC-2016-14: PR - RISK for Board Risk Register - That the articles of the Association are not fit for purpose regarding, particularly: Article 14.1 Architecture role of TC, Article 9.1 No mention of contributors, Article 21.2 Indemnity of partners and contributors.
18.  ACTION-SC-2016-15: WQ(TC) - Define the roles in the development process - see JT doc.
19.  ACTION-SC-2016-16: JT - Clarify articles that may appear to force other people to pay for your project.
20.  RESOLUTION-SC-2016-07:Resolution: vote: 7-0 in favour - JT is tasked to amend the Internal Rules to reflect what we have discussed here today about managing multiple projects.
Management of Contributor License Agreements
1.    Contributor License Agreement
2.    JT - A lot of contributors won’t want to physically post a form to our Belgian address. I suggest we amend the Internal Rules… see JT paper.
3.    BB - Why not have an umbrella agreement?
4.    ACTION-SC-2016-20: JT/PR - Talk to Michael Robbins about whether an umbrella agreement would have legal standing.
5.    JT – I suggest an online CLA form
6.    BB - Not sure click-through will be valid
7.    ACTION-SC-2016-21: JT/PR - Work with Michael to determine legal validity in all territories of a click-through online CLA - and validity under Belgian law. Refer to legal contact of IRM?
8.    Example CLA management service: CLA Assistant - (MG gave a demo of a click-through CLA)
9.    BB - One OSS project that wanted to change its licence had to contact every contributor, so they needed a list.
10.  JT - So this would be a simpler way to manage the licence agreements than managing paper copies.
11.  ACTION-SC-2016-22: JT - Come up with suitable method for managing CLAs. Bring back to SC to approve by correspondence. Update CLA process and forms if approved.
12.  JT - SC confirm that a single CLA for all projects is preferred. And that we have an online system that manages the CLAs (otherwise TC will have to manage all the paperwork).
13.  NOTE: This needs a robust mechanism to backup/restore/copy the signed agreement. We must resolve this before our OSS release.

MDA - An Associate Partner will get a TC seat so long as they have the right skills. Worst case, they don’t get a seat on the TC, but that is unlikely.
JT - I propose a vote on this clarification: eligible to be in TC subject to qualifying criteria in article 14.2.
RESOLUTION-SC-2016-11:Resolution: vote: 6 in favour, 0 against and 1 abstained - Recommended to Board - clarification: eligible to be in TC subject to qualifying criteria in article 14.2.

1.    ACTION-AM-2016-01: WQ/PR - draft a process for separating PMC/TC tasks into appropriate meetings.
2.    ACTION-AM-2016-02: JT/SC - agree smart metrics for each goal by June SC.

Annual Meeting  (Board) Seoul 2016

Approval of changes to Internal Rules (see Rule A12.17)
1.    Financial controls for the OpenWIS Association (Treasurer)
1.    EE – Please refer to attachment [ATT-AM-2016-2 OpenWIS Financial Management FINAL] which I provide as an annex to the Internal Rules around financial governance. The purpose of this document is to make sure we all understand how the financial matters of the Association work. It covers approvals and processing of payments, required authorisations, tax, setting budgets and Belgian Rules for filing accounts. Are there any questions?
2.    JT - I note that the board can sign-off EUR9,999.99 ie: just under EUR10k.
3.    JT – So, as treasurer, your role is to make sure we have financial concurrence against the budget? So invoices come in and you say, yes, that is within the budget?
4.    EE - Yes.
5.    MDA - Regarding the definition of Small and Large organisations - Small is say 2 employees and EUR20k revenue. Say we have a new Strategic Partner coming in, they will contribute EUR200,000. Is that not a problem, if we consider ourselves a Small entity?
6.    EE - Large requires two of the 3 criteria. We have no employees at all, so we don’t meet that criteria. Therefore our total annual income would have to exceed EUR312k and the balance sheet would have to exceed EUR1.25 million as well, to qualify as Large.
7.    MDA - Do you take into account the employees of the NMSs?
8.    EE – No, they are not employees of the Association.
9.    JT - On page 2 - payment authorisation - the diagram shows we need to check that costs are budgeted for - does that mean we send the invoices to you?
10. EE - Usually you would seek financial approval ahead of entering into the transaction/agreement/contract.
11. JT - There is no mention of an obligation to seek a quote before entering into a contract – is that correct?
12. EE – It’s not written, but I would expect that to be the process followed normally.
13. JT - So shall we write that into the rules?
14. EE – Ok, that makes sense.
15. ACTION-AM-2016-04: EE – Amend the Internal Rules annex to oblige the seeking of quote(s) or estimate(s) and sending them to the Treasurer prior to entering contractual arrangements.
16. JT - Should we set a threshold value at which we get a quote, for example, to buy Amazon Web Services?
17. EE – Probably not, if you’re always going to get a quote anyway.
18. JT - So we’ll provide a quote or an estimate to you, to check that we are within budget before we commit to a transaction.
19. EE – Yes and so that I am aware what is coming.
20. WQ - So we don’t need to get 3 quotes? One quote is like getting no quotes.
21. JT – That depends on what you’re buying, but it would be worth adding a rule to recommend due diligence when purchasing.
22. ACTION-AM-2016-05: EE – Amend the Internal Rules annex to recommend due diligence when purchasing.
23. JT – On page 3 it says that proposed budgets need to be circulated 30 days ahead of the board meeting. If we were to comply with that we would have to separate the SC and Board meeting by 30 days, because the budget recommendation is drafted at the SC.
24. MDA - We also say in the articles that we hold the SC and Board meetings at the same time and same location, so that 30 days separation is impractical.
25. JT - The articles say only the accounts need to be circulated 30 days ahead of the board meeting.
26. ACTION-AM-2016-06: EE - Remove the 30 day rule about budgets from the Internal Rules annex.
27. MDA/JT - We’ll await the EE amended document and approve it tomorrow. EE does not need to approve it because the Treasurer is not a board member.
28. WQ - So this becomes an annex to the Internal Rules?
29. JT - Yes.

TC Oct 2016

Approve the draft contributor license that will be released alongside the software. The SC is currently waiting for this to be agreed on before having their own meeting
1.    WQ - Paul circulated a draft CLA.
2.    PR - Michael Robbins (UKMO Legal) has checked it and suggested two minor changes, but is happy with it. I will update the draft with Michael’s changes. Please send me any further suggestions for change.
3.    WQ - Do we all need to ratify the CLA?

5.    DW - When will the CLA be available?
6.    PR - When we go open source it will be on our website - we need something and this version will cover us.


Hi Jeremy,

While I’m pulling together the list of more technical agenda items we might choose from, here are a few thoughts on the formalities –thoughts welcome.

I have checked my email archive and can find no evidence that we have ever issued formal invites to the SC, or to the AM or the TC.  What I have found is an invite from the host organisation on the TC/SC mail lists that requests names and numbers of delegates for each meeting, eg: as from Okki last Feb, and draft agendas inviting comments.  If we are going to issue a formal invite, does it make sense to have one combined AM/SC/TC invite?

Annual Meeting and elections
The ARTICLES mention that the Annual Meeting must be called with at least 31 days notice (with draft accounts) but don’t say how or by whom, only that any MEMBER can call an EXTRAORDINARY meeting of the Board.

So the INTERNAL RULES will apply; they state that:

Rule 8.3: Notice of the Annual Meeting will be called by the Chair of the Board (or other Managing Director, if the Chair is VACANT).  Notice shall include: Location, date, time; and be accompanied by provisional agenda.
Rule 8.4: If it will be necessary to appoint Chair, VC, or Treasurer, the notice should say so and invite nominations.
Rule 7.4: Max Board election tenure is 4 yrs; 2 plus 2 further years with re-election; incumbents must give 3 months notice (to other delegates) of intention to stand for re-election.

The Date of Incorporation on which the Board was formally established was 23rd August 2015.  Therefore, the Board Chair and Vice-chair are up for re-election this year by 23rd August 2017.  This would require notice of intention to stand for re-election by 23rd May 2017. However, it seems sensible to go through the election process at the face-to-face in Toulouse, both to allow for proper discussion and time for a handover period if there is any change.

Steering Committee Meeting and elections
Rule 8.13: Notice of the Steering Committee will be called by the Chair of the SC.  Notice shall include: Location, date, time; and be accompanied by provisional agenda.
Rule 7.5: Max SC election tenure is 4 yrs; 1 + 1 + 1 +1; incumbents must give 1 month notice (to other delegates) of intention to stand for re-election.
However, this needs updating to reflect the resolution from the last AM:
1.    JT – The SC recommends an amendment to the Internal Rules to say that, for SC-Chair and SC-Vice-Chair, ‘the default tenure is 2 years and that re-election is routine unless others want to stand’.
2.    RESOLUTION-AM-2016-10: Vote: 5-0 in favour – Rule changes on default tenure are Approved.
Both incumbents, Loic and yourself, were elected 2 years ago in 2015 at the Melbourne meeting.  Therefore, both positions are up for re-election this year.  Notice of intention to stand for re-election is required by 22nd Feb for the SC.

Technical Committee Meeting and elections
There are no articles or rules relating to the meetings of the Technical Committee.
Rule 14.4: Max TC election tenure is 4 yrs; 1 + 1 + 1 +1; no mention of any notice of intention to stand for re-election.  It seems like an anomaly now, that TC Chair and VC aren’t also 2 year tenures by default.

Weiqing was elected 2 years ago in Melbourne and re-elected last year so Chair is up for election.  Steve Olson was elected 1 year ago so VC is also up for election.  Steve might fancy the Chair position if Weiqing doesn’t want to continue.  Maybe Leon for TC VC?  Other TC VC options could be Michael Claudon or Hyekyoung Lee.

So I think we definitely need to make the call for nominations for SC and TC.  Do you want to discuss with Matteo whether we call for Board nominations now as well?

Cheers,
Paul
