Ready for CBS Nov 2016. Just need CMTeam to switch the OpenWIS/openwis, OpenWIS/openwis4 and OpenWIS/openwis-documentation repos from private to public and tag the release package (3.14.7?).

There is a [project](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis/projects/1) for this task on GitHub.

User story: As a potential open source contributor, user or association member, I want:

  - a package I can download that contains the OSS version of OpenWIS 3.14, ready for installation,
  - an installation guide.
