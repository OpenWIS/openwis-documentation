Adopt Markdown and surrounding tools as documentation standard and appoint a document custodian from the partners.

LM - The collateral for the website should and other doc will be worth thinking about before we start writing doco for version4. LM - Estimate includes rewriting existing doco in Markdown.

PR - Choosing a modern, open documentation standard is a blocker for going open-source and therefore it is also a blocker for v4.  Declaring the standard and providing a means to apply it (eg: gh-pages) is sufficient to complete this task.  Writing all the documentation to that standard will be a whole series of follow-on tasks that arise as-and-when we need to do them.  In any case, we can reference the old docs from the new, until everything is naturally converted as they need to be updated for other reasons.

### Dev Con 2016 update

PR - The initial website has been built and NWS are taking forward the further development of the website using the Jekyll/Markdown/Github toolset.  That work continues under Kanban item 78.
