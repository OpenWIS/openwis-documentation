A-OWIS-SC-2016-25 RGib - Improve the existing web-site, both look and content (nothing grand). LM - See the above two tickets about this. Also, may need to make a decision as to technologies we use for the website (Joomla, Jekyll, etc.) LM - Estimate includes setting up new websight and writing some content but does NOT include the two tasks above (76 & 77).

PR - We haven't developed the existing website and it is inadequate for an open-source project.  The task remains to develop a better website, but I think it should be on gh-pages, which is much more accessible, both to our current developers and those to come as we expand or go open-source.

So let's make the purpose of this task to develop a better website on gh-pages.
