Enhancement DM1: Default metadata insertion. LM - I'm not sure what this refers to

This task was part of the OpenWISv4/GeoNetworksv3 [work package][WP] assigned to GeoCat in 2015.  The [documentation][doc] produced as part of that work describes the new functionality delivered.

[doc]: {{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/OpenWISv4-GeoNetwork-2015-Documentation.pdf

The outcome for this feature was:

2015 status: **MO/GeoCat Review**; Percent complete: **100**; Priority: Normal; Questions outstanding: Does the status remain UNPUBLISHED?;

Extra info:

GeoNetwork shall be amended such that a software agent is able to insert a metadata record into the catalogue wherein it is associated with a specific Group and its status remains unpublished.
