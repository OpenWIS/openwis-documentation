Update - scrum - 2017-01-17: DW and LM will use the OpenWIS4 and CGN demo instances to assess the features and the workflow of GeoNetwork to see how it meets the needs of the OpenWIS community.  Ultimately, we will need a formal proposal about which features to adopt, preferably for the Toulouse meeting.

This assessment will include assessing the role of categories in CGN and OpenWIS, including Kanban item 97 (role of category in metadata sync).  This assessment will also include Kanban item 62 (delegation of management of Users and Groups to GeoNetwork - _an alternative to using OpenAM_).

This is related to Kanban item 55 v4 - AAC1 SAML2, in that these are alternatives.  Some organisations will want SSO whereas some will want a local OpenWIS authN and authZ.  Once they have decided on a method then they will likely stick with it.
