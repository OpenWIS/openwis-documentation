Extra info:

Geonetwork shall be amended to provide an Administrator with a web based mechanism to:

  1. browse the content of the product metadata table; and
  2. for specific records, override attributes (e.g. dissemination priority) that have been extracted from the associated metadata record in the catalogue.

The ProductMetadataService SOAP web-service provides a mechanism to interact with the product metadata table.
