Extend the Data Harness.

PN is currently assessing the state of the Harness on 3.14 and DW will do some testing.  It is likely that we will need to tidy up the Harness code and fix a few minor bugs in preparation for any major changes we decide to introduce for v4.  We should also review where the Harness code is kept (which repo); even though each association member tends to run their own Harness(es), we should share a repo so we can learn from each other's code and perhaps develop some common Harness components.

PR - Let's review the position in Oct 2016.
