Update - scrum - 2017-01-17: Having this is good practice.  We will review the outputs once we have settled on the set of libs we will use for OpenWIS4, to look for any remaining vulnerabilities.

MG - OWASP - An automatic report on library vulnerabilities is now included in the routine build. Reporting some high and medium priority issues at present, which will need to be investigated. TC to review - may need to remove some libs. LM - Outcome of Owasp might need a review.
