Update - 2017-02-22 DW: GeoNetwork 3 appears to have some extra search/discovery capabilities
that were not present or visible in the older version of GeoNetwork we use with OpenWIS 3.14.  
It could be worthwhile exploring these for possible adoption into OpenWIS v4.

This topic will be covered by Dom's presentation in Toulouse 2017.
