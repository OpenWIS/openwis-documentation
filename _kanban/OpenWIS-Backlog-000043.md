This task was part of the OpenWISv4/GeoNetworksv3 [work package][WP] assigned to GeoCat in 2015.  The [documentation][doc] produced as part of that work describes the new functionality delivered.

[doc]: {{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/OpenWISv4-GeoNetwork-2015-Documentation.pdf

The outcome for this feature was:

2015 status: **MO/GeoCat Review**; Percent complete: **100**; Priority: Normal; Questions outstanding: Can we extract specific data products from the cache?;

Extra info:

GeoNetwork shall be amended to provide an Administrator with a web-based mechanism to:

  1. browse the content of the global cache; and
  2. extract specific data products from the cache.

The CacheIndexService SOAP web-service provides a mechanism to interact with the cache.
