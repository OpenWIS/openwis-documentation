User right access on metadata editor.

**LM** - Please confirm this works in GeoNetworks 3.  If so, close this ticket.

**PR** - It would be useful if **MF**, who have real users, could mock-up their v3 user population on a v4 instance and then check they can assign rights properly, and that they work as they think they should (see issue #73).  This will have to wait until we have a v4 instance worth testing.  For now, I will park this under TEST and assign to MF for later when an instance is available.
