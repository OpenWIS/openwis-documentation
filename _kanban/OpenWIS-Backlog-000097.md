Update - scrum - 2017-01-17: DW and LM will use the OpenWIS4 and CGN demo instances to assess the features and the workflow of GeoNetwork to see how it meets the needs of the OpenWIS community.  Ultimately, we will need a formal proposal about which features to adopt, preferably for the Toulouse meeting.

This assessment will include assessing the role of categories in CGN and OpenWIS, including Kanban item 97 (role of category in metadata sync).  This assessment will also include Kanban item 62 (delegation of management of Users and Groups to GeoNetwork - _an alternative to using OpenAM_).

The role of Category for metadata sync.

*LM* - Are categories in GN conceptually different than they were in OpenWIS 3.14?  Please check.
