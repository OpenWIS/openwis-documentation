				 This site is generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.  
				 	Most of the content is written using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> 
					and then transformed by Jekyll using <a href="http://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">Liquid</a> 
					and supporting <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">HTML and CSS </a> 
					(or <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>) templates.

<h3>Issues</h3>
			<p>
				 The MS Edge browser won't show the favicon on the tab (when running from the local web-server) - SO has no solution.  
				 Chrome only shows it when the SO solution 
				 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13780402/html-favicon-wont-show-on-google-chrome">:/favicon.ico?r=31241</a> 
				 is applied.  This appears to be an aggressive-caching problem that shouldn't affect the site when run from a remote webserver.
			</p>
			<p>
				 The Jekyll site warns about Byte Order Markers in files created on Windows (they crash the Jekyll build) and I have had to 
				 remove these occassionally with a Hex editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				 There is another problem that may be related - any accented chars in the Markdown (eg: the 'e's in Meteo) also crash the build.
				 I am avoiding the problem at the moment by using only ANSI chars and editing out any accents, even though Jekyll is meant to support UTF-8.
				 There is a conversation taking place within the Jekyll community about Internationalisation (i18n) that perhaps will provide an answer,
				 but I haven't found it yet (queue Michael Buble sans accent). Most of the i18n involves plugins, which won't work for gh-pages, 
				 because Jekyll runs there in '--safe' mode with plugins disabled.
