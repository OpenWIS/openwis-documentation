## Overview of OpenWIS Association and WIS 2 Prototype Pilot Studies
The OpenWIS Association is conducting a series of WIS 2 prototype studies designed to test draft version of the WIS 2 Technical Specification before the Association is asked to build the next version of OpenWIS using the WIS 2 spec.  Findings from these studies will be used to brief WMO and various Task Teams and Expert teams.  Findings from these studies may also be demonstrated in future CBS Teco meetings as well.
## WIS2-PoC-1
This initial WIS 2 pilot study focused on better discoverability of GISC content, and better ways to understand the metadata, data location and ways to obtain data (adding pub-sub requests).  The github area for this WIS 2 study can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenWIS/WIS2-PoC-1).  This WIS2 study was demo'd at the CBS TECO meeting in 2017.

### WIS2-POC-AMQP
The goal if this new WIS2 prototype study is to test whether or not new message queue protocols, such as AMQP, MQTT & STOMP can address weather data dissemination issues?  Particular focus will be on AMQP, and whether or not it is the ideal candidate for other weather data exchanges.
