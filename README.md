# openwis-documentation
Documentation repository for the OpenWIS Association AISBL. This project uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build HTML documentation from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The early stages of this project will concentrate on documenting the governance framework of the OpenWIS Association. More will be added as time goes on ...

For tips on writing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) see the [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To build the documentation site, we're using the `github-pages` gem from GitHub and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). More information about using Jekyll with GitHub-Pages can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). So- to build from the command-line:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

That's it.
