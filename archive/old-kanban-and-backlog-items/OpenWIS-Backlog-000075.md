Done - main repos now PUBLIC.

PR - We're ready to go open source.  Will get CMTeam to switch the repos from private to public w/b 21 Nov 2016.

There is a [project](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis/projects/1) for this task on GitHub.

User story: As a potential open source contributor, user or association member, I want:

  - a package I can download that contains the OSS version of OpenWIS 3.14, ready for installation,
  - an installation guide.
