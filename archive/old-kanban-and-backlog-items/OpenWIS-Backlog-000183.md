Fork GeoNetwork 3.2.  Add tag IDs to the UI TILES, as required to allow OpenWIS 'plugins'.  Submit a pull-request to the GeoNetwork project.  It may be best to submit a number of pull requests, so that Geonetwork only have to review a small number of changes each time and get used to us making contributions.

Kanban task 81 is a blocker for this task.
