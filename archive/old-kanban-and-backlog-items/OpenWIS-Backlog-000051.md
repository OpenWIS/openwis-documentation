The outcome for this feature was:

2015 status: **MO/GeoCat Review**; Percent complete: **100**; Priority: Normal; Questions outstanding: Does the status remain UNPUBLISHED?;

Extra info:

GeoNetwork shall be amended such that a software agent is able to insert a metadata record into the catalogue wherein it is associated with a specific Group and its status remains unpublished.
