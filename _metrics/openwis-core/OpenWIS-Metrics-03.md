## Goal 3. Make OpenWIS-Core software easily customisable for deployment at WIS centres ##
- Metric 3.1: To be able to integrate with a new data-source or dissemination component (that is exposed via a REST web service API) without needing to modify source-code; configuration changes only.
- Metric 3.2: Basic customisation (e.g. colour, theme etc.) of web-based UI requires a simple configuration change only.
