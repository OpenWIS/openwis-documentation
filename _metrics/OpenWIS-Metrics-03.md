  3. Make OpenWIS software easily customisable for deployment at WIS centres
    - Metric 3.1: to be able to integrate with a new data-source or dissemination component (that is exposed via a REST web service API) without needing to modify source-code; configuration changes only.
    - Metric 3.2: basic customisation (e.g. colour, theme etc.) of web-based UI requires CSS change only â€¦ note dependency on GeoNetwork.
