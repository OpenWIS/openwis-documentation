<h2 id="rule-3.1">Rule 3.1</h2>

The Association’s registered office address is at the offices of the Belgian Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI): Ringlaan 3, Avenue Circulaire, B-1180, Brussels, Belgium. This address shall be clearly mentioned on all documents produced by the Association. In order to avoid placing unnecessary administrative burdens on RMI, care should be taken to ensure correspondence is prominently marked for the attention of the OpenWIS Association.

<h2 id="rule-3.1">Rule 3.1</h2>

The Board is empowered to change the registered office of the Association, in line with applicable legislation.

It is not anticipated that the Association will require office space for the carrying out of its day-to-day activities. In the first instance, efforts should be made to find sufficient space at Members’ premises. Nevertheless, the Board remains empowered to set up administrative offices and branches both in Belgium and abroad, if this would be conducive to the achievement of the Association’s purpose.
