<h2 id="rule-5.1">Rule 5.1</h2>

In accordance with [Article 9]({{ "/articles/9-organizational-partners-and-relationship-with-other-third-parties.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the Association offers to the opportunity for people and organisations who are not Members to participate in the development of the OpenWIS Software. Such persons and organisations are known as “Partners”.

<h2 id="rule-5.2">Rule 5.2</h2>

Partners are classified as either Strategic Partners or Associate Partners, in accordance with [Article 9.2]({{ "/articles/9-organizational-partners-and-relationship-with-other-third-parties.html#article-9.2" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

<h2 id="rule-5.3">Rule 5.3</h2>

In accordance with [Article 9.3]({{ "/articles/9-organizational-partners-and-relationship-with-other-third-parties.html#article-9.3" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), a person or organisation may only become a Strategic Partner or Associate Partner after approval by the Board, following a recommendation by the Steering Committee.

<h2 id="rule-5.4">Rule 5.4</h2>

Persons or organisations wishing to become a Partner of the Association should submit a written request to the Chairperson of the Steering Committee, indicating whether that person or organisation wishes to become a Strategic Partner or an Associate Partner. The application should set out the candidate’s name, its tasks, activities, corporate purpose and legal status, provide details of its interests in the field of meteorology and briefly set out why it wishes to become a Partner of the Association and how it might contribute to the realisation of the Association’s objectives.

<h2 id="rule-5.5">Rule 5.5</h2>

Candidates for the granting of Strategic or Associate Partner status should fall into one of the following categories:

* National Meteorological Services recognised by the World Meteorological Organization;
* Government Organisations which hold a mandate or authority to carry out weather and climate research and services;
* Other Public Organisations which, in the opinion of the Board, are constituted for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose and objectives of the Association; 
* Other Non-Profit Organisations (including Non-Governmental Organisations) which, in the opinion of the Board, are constituted for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose and objectives of the Association;
* In the case of Associate Partners, private companies which, in the opinion of the Board, have a corporate purpose which is compatible with the purpose and objectives of the Association.

<h2 id="rule-5.6">Rule 5.6</h2>

In deciding whether to grant any person or organisation Strategic or Associate Partner status, the Board should consider the following matters:

* The compatibility of the candidate’s corporate purpose with the purpose of the organisation;
* The financial soundness of the candidate;
* The scientific and technical capability of the candidate and the compatibility of these capabilities with the Association’s purpose and its current and future strategic programmes and work plans;
* Whether admission of the candidate would best serve the interests of the Association and its existing Members and Partners in ensuring that the purpose and objectives of the Association are met; and
* Any other matter which the Board reasonably feels may have a bearing on its decision.

<h2 id="rule-5.7">Rule 5.7</h2>

A person or organisation who has been approved by the Board becomes a Strategic Partner or Associate Partner of the Association on the happening of the latter of the following two events:

* Signing a contract to become a Strategic Partner or Associate Partner (as the case may be)
* Paying the fee(s) outlined in [Rule 6.2]({{ "/rules/6-membership-and-partnership-fees-rights-privileges-and-obligations.html#rule-6.2" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of these [Internal Rules]({{ "/rules/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

<h2 id="rule-5.8">Rule 5.8</h2>

Partners of the Association must abide by the terms of their contract with the Association, these [Internal Rules]({{ "/rules/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and decisions of the Board and the Steering Committee.

<h2 id="rule-5.9">Rule 5.9</h2>

A Partner whose contract with the Association terminates or expires for any reason shall cease to be a Partner of the Association from the date of such termination or expiry. 

<h2 id="rule-5.10">Rule 5.10</h2>

Failure of a Partner to pay any fees or contributions applicable to such a Partner (as laid down in [Rule 6.2]({{ "/rules/6-membership-and-partnership-fees-rights-privileges-and-obligations.html#rule-6.2" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of these [Internal Rules]({{ "/rules/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})) by the due date shall be a matter that justifies termination of any contract with that Partner.

<h2 id="rule-5.11">Rule 5.11</h2>

If any Partner puts the Association’s activities at risk by failing to meet its contractual obligations, such failure may be reported to the Steering Committee who may convene an Extraordinary Meeting to decide whether a request should be made to the Board to terminate the Association’s contract with the Partner.

<h2 id="rule-5.12">Rule 5.12</h2>

Non-Partner organisations which are willing to contribute to the achievement of the Association’s objectives may participate in workshops and conferences organised by the Association and conduct work or research under contract.

<h2 id="rule-5.13">Rule 5.13</h2>

A Partner may decide to terminate their contract with the Association at any time by giving written notice to the Board.
