In accordance with [Article  12.3]({{ "/articles/12-board.html#article-12.3" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the Board must hold its annual meeting before July in each year. The Annual Meeting must always be held at such a time as will allow the annual accounts of the Association to be prepared and approved in a timely manner in accordance with Belgian law.

<h2 id="rule-8.2">Rule 8.2</h2>

As a general principle, Annual Meetings should be held in each Member country by rotation. However, the Board may decide to hold an Annual Meeting in a different location if this is convenient. Annual Meetings of the Board may also be conducted by video conference or other means of instantaneous communication. The order of rotation shall be as follows:

* France
* United Kingdom
* Republic of Korea
* Australia

<h2 id="rule-8.3">Rule 8.3</h2>

Annual Meetings should always be called on at least 31 days notice, which should be circulated to all current Representatives by the Chairperson of the Board (or another Managing Director, in the event that the Chairperson’s office is vacant) and should give the date, time, and location of the meeting, together with any dial-in or other technical details in the event that the meeting is to be wholly or partly conducted by teleconference, etc. The notice should also be accompanied by a provisional agenda. Should any Representative wish to add an item to the agenda, that Representative should inform the Chairperson of the Board (or other Managing Director, in the event that the Chairperson’s office is vacant) at least three weeks before the Annual Meeting.

<h2 id="rule-8.4">Rule 8.4</h2>

Notice of the meeting should be circulated to all current Representatives by the Chairperson of the Board (or another Managing Director, in the event that the Chairperson’s office is vacant) and should give the date, time, and location of the meeting, together with any dial-in or other technical details in the event that the meeting is to be wholly or partly conducted by teleconference, etc. The notice should also be accompanied by a provisional agenda.

<h2 id="rule-8.14">Rule 8.14</h2>

Notice should be circulated to all current Delegates by the SC Chair and should give the date, time, and location of the meeting, together with any dial-in or other technical details in the event that the meeting is to be wholly or partly conducted by teleconference, etc. The notice should also be accompanied by a provisional agenda.

<h2 id="rule-8.18">Rule 8.18</h2>

In the event that any Member or Partner wishes to be represented at any meeting by a proxy in accordance with Articles [12.5]({{ "/articles/12-board.html#article-12.5" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) or [13.8]({{ "/articles/13-steering-committee.html#article-13.8" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the written, signed proxy should be presented to the chairperson of the meeting at the earliest opportunity. Each meeting should consider how many Members and/or Partners are present (and, therefore, whether the meeting is quorate) before moving on to consider the agenda.
