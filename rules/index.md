These **Internal Rules** are supplementary and subordinate to the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of the **OpenWIS AISBL**, an International Non-Profit Organisation (*Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif*) registered under Belgian law on **23 August 2015**.

The purpose of these **Internal Rules** is to implement the provisions [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and to regulate the day-to-day activities of the **Association**. They establish administrative rules and set down the financial commitments of the **Members**, without violating either the spirit or the letter of the [{{ site.data.articles.title }}]({{ site.data.articles.subpath | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

In the case of any contradiction between these **Internal Rules** and the [Articles of Association]({{ "/articles/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the latter shall prevail.

The current version of the **Internal Rules** are provided below.
