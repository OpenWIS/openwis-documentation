Thank you for your interest in contributing to products owned or managed by the OpenWIS Association AISBL.

Your details will be processed in accordance with European Data Protection Law.  Personal data processed by the OpenWIS Association AISBL will not be disclosed to third parties for marketing purposes, but may be disclosed to members of the OpenWIS Association AISBL for the purposes of managing your contributions.

<h2 id="3-intellectual-property-infringement">3. Intellectual property infringement</h2>

If any third party makes any claim against You or any other entity, alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, infringes the intellectual property rights of that third party, then You shall inform the OpenWIS Association AISBL within five (5) Working Days of such claim in order for the OpenWIS Association AISBL to take all appropriate action it deems necessary in relation to the claim.

<h2 id="4-legal-entitlement">4. Legal entitlement</h2>

<span style="background-color:yellow">*When appropriate, details of source, license, other restrictions and the identification that the submission is provided on behalf of a named third-party may be included within the Pull Request associated with the submission of work that is not Your original creation.*</span>

<h2 id="7-notification">7. Notification</h2>

You agree to notify the OpenWIS Association AISBL of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect. You further agree to fully indemnify, and keep indemnified, the OpenWIS Association AISBL against any losses suffered as a result of any fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation made by you under Clauses [4](#4-legal-entitlement), [5](#5-contribution-of-your-creations) or [6](#6-contribution-of-creation-on-behalf-of-third-party).

<h2 id="8-dispute-resolution">8. Dispute resolution</h2>

The Parties shall attempt in good faith to negotiate a settlement to any dispute arising between them out of or in connection with this Agreement within 30 Working Days of the dispute arising.

If the dispute cannot be resolved, then the Parties shall attempt to settle it by mediation in accordance with the Belgian Centre for Arbitration and Mediation (“EPANI”) Model Mediation Procedure from time-to-time in force.

To initiate the mediation a party to the Agreement must give notice in writing (the “ADR Notice”) to the other party requesting mediation in accordance with this clause.

<h2 id="9-mediation">9. Mediation</h2>

The mediation is to take place not later than 30 Working Days after the ADR Notice. If there is any issue on the conduct of the mediation upon which the Parties cannot agree within 14 Working Days of the ADR Notice, then EPANI shall, at the request of either party, decide the issue for the Parties, having consulted with them.

Unless otherwise agreed, all negotiations connected with the dispute and any settlement shall be conducted in confidence and without prejudice to the rights of the Parties in any future proceedings.

If the Parties reach agreement on the resolution of the dispute, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall be binding on the Parties once it is signed by both You and the OpenWIS Association AISBL.

If the Parties fail to reach agreement within 60 Working Days of the initiation of the mediation, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties, then any dispute or difference between them may be referred to the courts.

Nothing in this Agreement affects the right of You or the OpenWIS Association AISBL to apply to the court for urgent interim equitable relief (including, but not limited to, an injunction).
