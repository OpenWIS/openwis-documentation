<h2 id="article-8.1">Article 8.1</h2>

In the event of a Member putting the Organization’s activities at risk by not meeting its obligations or commitments vis-à-vis the Organization, included but not limited to any payment obligations, the Board may decide the exclusion of that Member, whereby such Member shall not be taken into account for presence or approval quorum.

<h2 id="article-8.2">Article 8.2</h2>

Any Member who, through exclusion, ceases to belong to the Organization, shall not be entitled to any share of the Organization's funds and may not claim a refund of membership dues previously paid.

<h2 id="article-8.3">Article 8.3</h2>

Any Member who is excluded from the Organization may subsequently apply for readmission. Such application shall be governed by the same criteria set out in [ARTICLE 6]({{ "/articles/6-admission-of-new-members.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), except that a candidate member who has previously been excluded from the Organization must make good any financial default to the Organization before the Board may consider its application.
