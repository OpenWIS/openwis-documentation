<h2 id="article-10.1">Article 10.1</h2>

The running costs of the Organization shall be met by way of membership fees, subscriptions and contributions in the amount and manner provided for in the [Internal Rules]({{ "/rules/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Different fees, subscriptions and contributions may apply in respect of Members, Strategic Partners, Associate Partners and Contributing Partners.  

<h2 id="article-10.2">Article 10.2</h2>

Should the Steering Committee identify that the Organization requires additional finance beyond that generated through membership fees, subscriptions and contributions, the matter shall first be discussed by the Steering Committee. In accordance with [ARTICLE 13]({{ "/articles/13-steering-committee.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})), the Steering Committee should then recommend that the Organization seek such additional finance on the basis of equal contributions by the Members and Strategic Partners. The Steering Committee may recommend that additional contributions (in money or in kind) be sought from the Associate and Contributing Partners on a voluntary basis. Acting on such recommendations, the requirement for additional finance shall be: (i) voted upon by the Board; (ii) granted to the Organization on the basis of equal contributions from the Members and Strategic Partners;  (iii) Additional voluntary contributions (in money or in kind) from the Associate and Contributing Partners as may have been recommended by the Steering Committee.

<h2 id="article-10.3">Article 10.3</h2>

Where there has been no financial recommendation from the Steering Committee, and particularly where the Board has identified the need for additional finance without the matter being discussed by the Steering Committee, the requirement for additional finance shall be: (i) voted upon by the Board; and (ii) granted to the Organization on the basis of equal contributions from the Members exclusively.
