14. **Any other business**
    - JT - I was concerned that we were losing focus of the OpenWIS direction. However, following the discussion and agreement at the SC, I am very happy that we have a clear and agreed direction of the Association.
    - LG - We have to deal with a difficult software which is not interesting. Also, the user community not ready to accept software and WIS. However, the approach to WIS2 is broader and we would likely to see new type of users. So, it is more interesting and rewarding to develop software for this proposition. Very happy to the Dev Con and TC in September 2019.
    - RGr - Agree on what has been said. However, I would not put the expectation too high as there is a slowdown due to WMO restructure. We can push, as an Association and help to make WIS2 a reality but it will be a few years before WIS2 is a reality.
   - JT - I would add that messaging (AMQP) is a proactive step that we can make progress on ahead on WIS2.
   - RGr - At the Dev Con, would it make sense to invite Peter Silva to share technical views on AMQP on one of the days.
   - JT - from a Met Office perspective we need to understand who is best to come to the Dev Con.
   - RGr - any other AOB.
   - KMA- We have not contributed a lot of things to OpenWIS due to not having access to software developers. I have secured the budget to work with soft dev to start and continue development who we can take part in the Dev Con.
   - JT - Not heard from BoM and no other business.
   - RGr – happy to see that KMA has more resources and will be able to contribute and participate.

15. **Confirm the host of next meeting**
   - RGr - We have provisional confirmation from BoM. I believe that 4 days would be enough time and we should get the dates firmed up as soon as possible.

   [Action RGr and JT to discuss hosting the annual meeting 2020 with WQ](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/558)
   - KMA - will we need another Board meeting.
   - RGr - We would need a Board meeting to approve the changes to the articles of association recommended in October 2019 by the SC, which can a short WebEx session.

16. **Close**
