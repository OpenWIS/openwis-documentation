  documentation/issues/558
- RGr - the approach is to have virtual meetings, given the travel and isolation requirements
  brought about by the COVID19 pandemic.  So, we need to agree a suitable time-slots and shorter sessions for TC, SC and Board meeting during mid to end May 2020.

  meetings. Therefore, are present Board members in agreement?

  first, within the next two weeks and will inform dates for SC and Board

- RGr - Are two-hour slots are OK?
- WQ - two hours may be too short.  I can start at 7pm local time for BoM. Is this OK for USA?
- SO - that will be 4am is USA, so not good.
- RGr - So, 9pm local time in BoM is OK?
- SO and KS - Yes
- WQ- 9pm is OK.
- RGr – OK so, 3 hours from 9pm?
- WQ - Yes.
- RGr – Is two 3-hour sessions OK for SC and Board?
- JT - Yes
- RGr - So overall, 2 sessions of 3 hours for TC, SC and Board each, staring at 9pm Melbourne time
  in May 2020.  This should be a 7am start for Washington and either: 12am; 13pm or 2pm starts in Europe.
