6. **OpenWIS Association Membership**

7. **OpenWIS Association Partners**
    1. **Status update - designation of current Partners**
        1. MDA
    2. **Approval of new Partners recommended by the SC**
        1. JT - So last year, the Board approved the partnership with ECMWF. We discussed the progress at the SC and there are a few issues to escalate to the Board.
        2. RGr - Yes, the ECMWF Associate Partner Agreement has come back with some comments from their lawyer Gregor. MR has also made some comments, but it's all legalise, so some discussion is required before I can take this forward.
        1. RGr - Regarding clause 12.2.4:
            1. RGr - If we keep _twice_ then the Association has to pay more.
            2. MR - Yes, I think Gregor is trying to reduce ECMWF liabilities. We should point out that it's only the Association's liability that is affected by this clause.
            3. RGr - So, we rewrite 12.2.4, or we accept _one-time_.
            4. MR - That would mean we pay no compensation.
            5. MDA - So go for _one-time_; it's in the interests of the Association.
            6. MR - Ok.
        2. RGr - Regarding _confidential information_:
            1. MDA - We reject Gregor's suggestion and accept the document as it is; if it's confidential then you must mark it.
            2. MR - It is not requiring you to label it _CONFIDENTIAL_, but to treat the information as confidential, if it has been declared to be confidential, directly or indirectly.
            3. RGr - Ok, done.
        3. RGr - Regarding Appendix B:
            1. JT - Just add the Kanban link to Appendix B - [here](http://openwis.github.io/openwis-documentation/kanban/); that is the work plan.
            2. RGr - Ok, done.
        4. RGr - Regarding 4.4: We accept that? Ok, done.
        5. RGr - Accept 4.5? Ok, done.
        6. RGr - Accept 4.6? Ok, done.
        7. RGr - Regarding 9.1, VAT:
            1. RGr - We're not sure if contributions are bound to incur VAT in Belgium.
            2. MR - We think not; EE says the Association is not registered for tax. But, if someone declares that tax is due, we can ask for extra.
            3. RGr - In addition, we know that ECMWF are not bound to pay VAT.
            4. MR - Yes, but it doesn't make a difference; the clause says _if applicable_.
            5. RGr - ECMWF are always very careful about VAT.
            6. MR - They have accepted this clause with other agreements, but it doesn't hurt to take it out.
            7. RGr - I said I would check with the Belgian tax expert. If _NO_, we'll remove; if _YES_ we will need to rephrase.
        8. RGr - Regarding 9.2:
            1. RGr - We know they want to pay on an annual basis, so why not say that here?
            2. MDA - Ok, yes, make that change.
            3. MR - Put: _The Associate has chosen to pay on an annual basis_.
            4. RGr - Ok, done.
            5. MR - And: _The Association shall invoice on this basis_.
            6. RGr - Ok, done.
        9. JT - Just referring back to 4.5:
            1. JT - We're proposing to amend the Internal Rules, to say in Rule 5, that: _A partner may terminate their contract at any time, subject to 3 months notice_.
        10. RGr - Regarding 19.1:
            1. MR - It doesn't need to change because _Agreement_ is a defined term that includes the Internal Rules; leave it as it is.
            2. MDA - Ok.
            3. RGr - I added a comment: _see definition and interpretation_.
        11. RGr - Regarding 22.2:
            1. MR - The Act in Belgium suggests mediation before court. Arbitration can be done anywhere; can arbitrate on Belgian law in the UK, if they want.
            2. RGr - So keep the initial text and reject 22.3?
            3. MR - That's a different issue. He's meaning they are not subject to the jurisdiction of any courts; but that clause only refers to emergency injunctions. So, leave it as it is.
        12. JT - So, one more round of dialog with Gregor?
        13. RGr - So I will send it to MR and MR can send it to Gregor; you now have the feedback from the Board.
        14. JT - Make it clear that you are acting for the Association rather than the UKMO.
        15. RGr - Ok, send it back to me and I will send it to Gregor.
        16. MDA - Ok, but we need to confirm what he is objecting to.
        17. MR - We should try to explain why we think it is acceptable and in-line with the ECMWF convention.
        18. JT - So we need to speak to Gregor.
        19. SD - Re 9.1: what if they change their mind?
            1. MDA - They won't; it relates to their Copernicus contract.
            2. SD - Ok.
        20. RGr - So I will send to you, MR. You accept/reject changes and send back to me. Then a WebEx with Gregor?
            1. MR - Ok.
            2. {Covered by the previously agreed action at the SC: [Action-SC-2017-07 Finalise the ECMWF agreement](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/178)}
    3. **Fees, subscriptions and contributions to become strategic or associate partner**
        1. MDA
8. **Election of Managing Directors in August 2017**
    1. MDA - Review of applicable articles and rules
    2. MDA - Plan for nominations and elections
9. **Reports and recommendations from the SC**
    1. **Review of strategic programme and work plan(s)**
        1. JT - Work plan for coming year
        2. JT – Medium term goals (3 years)
    2. **Establishment of new Projects**
        1. JT
    3. **Formation of subsidiary bodies**
        1. JT
10. **Annual accounts from 2016 (Treasurer)**
    1. EE (Treasurer) presented via WebEx: Board Meeting - [Financial Matters]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2017-03-23-Board-Meeting-Financial-Matters.pdf); _slide 2_ to _slide 4_, incorporating the [Statement of Accounts]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2017-03-22-OpenWIS-Association-Accounts-2016.pdf).
        1. RGr - We have to publish the accounts for 2015 as well.
        2. EE - Yes. And the accounts have to be in French.
        3. RGr - Ok, the tax expert can translate.
        4. MDA - Please go through the document.
        5. {EE went through the Statement of Accounts and _slide 4_, line by line.}
        6. EE - Are there any other costs?
        7. MDA/JT - No.
        8. EE - So the balance sheet is at the bottom of the Statement of Accounts.
        9. RGr - So for 2016, the fine is zero for the Association. We paid it from the MF budget. We had to declare tax and were charged €200 by Vincent. There will be a fine for 2017 as well.
        10. JT - So what are you suggesting we should amend?
        11. MDA - Remove €200 for liability.
        12. EE - No, we recognise it as an accrual but add it to the member contribution.
        13. RGr - The expense occurred in 2016, so it is accrued.
        14. EE - Yes; it's when the activity happened.
        15. EE - Any further questions?
        16. MDA - Anyone around the table? Ok, none. So, shall we vote to approve the accounts?
        17. RES-OWIS-AM-2017-XX: Vote: 4-0 in favour – Statement of Accounts is Approved. OWIS-RES
    2. MDA - Status of OpenWIS Association bank account
        1. MDA - So we discussed the bank account during the SC.
        2. JT - Do we want to vote on giving up on ING?
        3. MDA - Right now give up on ING? I have spent a lot of time working with this guy in ING. I had to provide information from KMA and passport information. I sent that 2 weeks ago but I have not received feedback. It seems the bank account was created in January 2016, but was not _activated_ because some information was missing. But we didn't know and if there is no transaction within 9 months, the account is automatically closed. The information that the account had closed went to IRM; I don't know if some information went missing.
        4. JT - If you could find out how long this is going to take...
        5. MDA - They don't know, it goes through an agent.
        6. JT - If we haven't resolved this by July then we can't vote to drop ING.
        7. MDA - I will contact them tomorrow.
        8. JT - Let's give it one month and if there is no contact, we vote by correspondence to do something else.
        9. RES-OWIS-AM-2017-XX: Vote: 4-0 in favour – ING have one month to contact us before we vote on an alternative approach to set up of a bank account in Belgium. OWIS-RES
11. **Approval of budget for 2017**
    1. **Review of budget recommended by SC (SC Chair)**
        1. JT - So we all went through the budget items for the current year (2017) at the SC meeting {see SC section 16.3} and EE has listed some of them here: Board Meeting - [Financial Matters]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2017-03-23-Board-Meeting-Financial-Matters.pdf); _slide 5_.
        2. JT - The SC recommendation is that we provision €10,000 for 2017.
        3. JT - Last year we approved a reserve of €10,000 and I say we do so again.
        4. MDA - Yes, so let's vote.
        5. RES-OWIS-AM-2017-XX: Vote: 4-0 in favour – Budget proposal of €10,000 is approved. OWIS-RES
    2. **Approval of amount of reserve fund (see Rule R10.7)**
        1. MDA - And again for the reserve.
        2. RES-OWIS-AM-2017-XX: Vote: 4-0 in favour – Budget reserve of €10,000 is approved. OWIS-RES
12. **Approval of fees, subscriptions and contributions for 2017**
    1. MDA - We can continue with what we have. There will be a new rule on in-kind contributions. I propose we keep the current level of fees and subscriptions.
    2. JT - Are we also voting to accept the rule change in principle?
    3. MDA - Yes.
    4. RES-OWIS-AM-2017-XX: Vote: 4-0 in favour – Fees, subscriptions and contributions remain at 2016 values. Also, the rule change to cover in-kind contributions is approved in principle. OWIS-RES
13. **Approval of changes to Internal Rules (see Rule A12.17)**
    1. **Financial controls for the OpenWIS Association**
        1. MDA – Do we need the help of a professional company in Belgium to ensure we comply with the Belgian accounting and tax rules?
            1. RGr - So, last year when we discovered that we have to declare taxes on the Belgian website, we thought that would be difficult for us. Vincent Corbeel did it for us at a cost of €200. We discussed having something on a regular basis and discovered some other declarations we have to do.
            2. RGr - Vincent sent a costed proposal last week; the Annual fee would be €850 + VAT, to cover the tax declaration and the submission of accounts to Bank Nationale. This doesn't include fees to the Bank Nationale. If we have a contract with him then we can get help when we need it.
            3. JT - So we pay a retainer?
            4. MDA - The path to Bank Nationale: do we need that?
            5. EE - It might be filed with the Commercial Court, but we need to do something.
            6. RGr - Vincent said we had to declare at Bank Nationale, not less than 30 days after the Association approves the annual accounts. He said we can establish these accounts based on the EE documents and will need the passports of the directors. He said we will need to declare the 2015 accounts too, so I will send the EE docs to him.
            7. MDA - Any other comments? It's a pity we have to spend money on these things.
            8. MDA - Ok, we'll vote.
            9. RES-OWIS-AM-2017-XX: Vote: 4-0 in favour – Retain Vincent Corbeel for the submission of accounts and tax returns. OWIS-RES
        2. EE suggested rule change: to be added to the [Financial Rules Supplement]({{ "/rules2/2016-03-09-OpenWIS-Financial-Management.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
            1. **Support to meet Belgian Requirements (suggest adding after ‘Taxation’ section)**  It is recommended that the association engages with specialist support to ensure all legal, taxation and filing requirements are met. Costs need to be included in the budget to cover this.
        3. EE suggested rule change: to be added to the [Financial Rules Supplement]({{ "/rules2/2016-03-09-OpenWIS-Financial-Management.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
            1. **Benefit in Kind received by the Association (suggest adding after ‘Staff Costs’ section)**   As part of the operation of the association, the partners contribute effort to the furthering and support of the aims of the association. This can be in the form of external spend with other suppliers or use of internal resources of the partners (e.g. staff time) to achieve this. This is an in kind transaction of the association and as such to the extent that this is measurable, the association should record this in their accounts as an in kind transaction. For Income & Expenditure Statement purposes in the annual accounts, this is represented as a received income and a matching expense in the year. In order to fulfil this obligation, the partners are required to submit an annual return to the Treasurer confirming the amount of ‘in kind’ costs they have occurred. Partners should consider what information they need to retain in year to be able to do this and raise any queries with the Treasurer. Returns should be made on the provided [benefits-in-kind template]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/2017-03-23-Benefit-In-Kind-Template.docx).
    2. **Review of amendments recommended by SC (SC Chair)**
        1. JT
14. **Management of Risks to the Association**
    1. MDA
15. **Any Other Business**
16. **Host of next meeting**
    1. MDA
