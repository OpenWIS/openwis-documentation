    1. PR - 'features' and 'squads' and how they will work in practice ([lifecycle]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/howto/2017-03-17-OpenWIS-Development-Process.html)) / ([features and squads]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/howto/2017-03-17-OpenWIS-Features-and-Squads.html))
9. **Planning workshop**
    - [Workshop instructions]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/howto/2017-03-17-OpenWIS-Planning-Workshop.html)
    - [kanban board](http://openwis.github.io/openwis-documentation/kanban/)
    - [backlog](http://openwis.github.io/openwis-documentation/backlog/)
    - [github issues: OpenWIS4](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis4/issues)
    - [github issues: OpenWIS3](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis/issues)
    - [github issues: openwis-documentation](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues)
    - We will go through the kanban/backlog items and agree the following:
        - the definition and priority (MSCW) of each kanban/backlog item
        - which kanban/backlog items belong to which Features
        - which Features are candidates for releases 4.1 and 4.2
    - this will include work on the website and docs as well as the code (they are all on the kanban)
    - PR will add any new ideas to the backlog, preferably before the meeting, but can do during as well
    - new backlog items can just refer to an issue on GitHub, otherwise, a brief description would be useful for PR to publish on the website prior to the meeting (for example, the MF/INSPIRE question on the metadata query performance of OpenWIS v3 should be raised as a GitHub issue)
10.  **Allocation of people to squads to features**
    1. PR - work allocation:
        - establish who is interested in each feature
        - build squads accordingly
        - firm up on lists of Features for upcoming releases (eg: 3.14.9 and 4.1)
11. **Development facilities for OpenWIS4**
    1. MC - status of MF servers - are they useful and should we keep them?
    2. XX - status of AWS CI - is it still useful and should we repurpose it for v4?
12. **excel2wis**
    1. MC - Metadata tool [excel2wis](https://github.com/OpenWIS/excel2wis)
13. **Metadata hierarchies**
    1. DW - Why we need metadata hierarchies
14. **WIS 2.0**

15. **AOB**
16. **Summary for SC**
