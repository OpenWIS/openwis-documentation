title: OpenWIS Steering Committee 2017 March
---

#### 22nd - 23rd March 2017, Toulouse, France - meeting minutes

---

1. **Welcome and introductions**
    1. JT - Welcome everybody.
    2. JT - The agenda is somewhat formulaic, because there are certain things the Steering Committee must discuss at the annual meeting.
    3. JT - Last time we met, in Seoul a year ago, the intention was to have quarterly meetings. That didn't happen, so please accept my apologies. If we think we need a 3 month or 6 month meeting, then we can arrange to hold a meeting remotely.
2. **Approval of agenda**
	  1. JT - Is everyone happy with the agenda?
    2. JT - Noting that we have the flexibility to vary the discussion of some items as we go, the agenda is approved.
    3. JT - Also, we will pause the SC meeting tomorrow at 3pm, to have a couple of hours of the Board Meeting; this is so Emma, our Treasurer, can join us via WebEx.
3. **Declaration of delegates**
    1. JT - Here's reminder of the rules for the SC meeting:
        > A Delegate may represent up to one (1) other Member or Strategic Partner, besides the Member or Strategic Partner which appointed him or her, at a meeting of the Steering Committee. A written proxy, signed by the Member or Strategic Partner giving the proxy, shall be required for that purpose. The represented Member(s) and/or Strategic Partner(s) shall then be considered as present. (Article A13.8)
        > A meeting of the Steering Committee shall be quorate if at least three-quarters of the Members and Strategic Partners are together present. Delegates may be assisted by advisers at meetings of the Steering Committee. (Article A13.9)
        > Except where these Articles of Association require any matter to be decided unanimously, decision and recommendations of the Steering Committee shall be made by simple majority of those Delegates present. Each Delegate shall have one vote. (Article A13.10)
        > Associate  Partners may attend Steering Committee meetings as observers. WMO representatives may attend the Steering Committee meetings as observers to represent the interests of OpenWIS users. Observers may contribute to discussions but have no formal role in making decisions. (Article A13.13)
        > Resolutions and decisions of the Steering Committee shall be recorded in writing and made available to all Delegates. (Rule R8.14)

    2. JT - So, we are quorate, even if WQ can't hear us. Whenever WQ is not on WebEx, MDA is proxy.
    3. {The list of delegates, proxies and other participants is at the foot of these minutes}
4. **Approval of previous minutes**
    1. JT - Any issues with the previous minutes? Hearing none, the previous minutes are approved.
5. **Outstanding actions**
    1. PR - So, just running down the list of SC actions outstanding on 15th March, in reverse order:
        - 2016-32: EE - Check with Michael Robbins for fees related to trademarks.
            1. JT - OPEN - EE will join us for the Board Meeting later, so keep open until then.
        - 2016-31: BB - Will help develop a value proposition.  But I'm not ideal; people in WMO have that experience, so I will ask around to see if I can identify the right.
            1. JT - CLOSED - I will cover this on the agenda.
        - 2016-30: JT - Let's put targeted communications on the agenda for the next SC meeting.
            1. JT - CLOSED - I will cover this on the agenda.
        - 2016-28: JT - To write a strategy paper on: Where we can deliver the most value for the broader community in the near future.
            1. JT - CLOSED - I will cover this on the agenda. I have not written a strategy paper, but that has been overtaken by events around WIS 2.0 strategy recommendations to CBS and anticipated approval by Exec Council. We can add most value by continuing OpenWIS development and contributing to the WIS 2.0 Technical Specifications and running pilot projects.
            2. MDA - Yes, the Association will bring a lot to 2.0.
            3. JT - What is the view from CBS?
            4. MDA - At the CBS last November, a strategy for the development of WIS 2.0 was proposed. During the management meeting a month ago, we looked at the way to implement WIS 2.0. We need a clear understanding of the stakeholders needs and we need to run a pilot project.
            5. MDA - CBS is looking at a project in Region I (Africa) or III (South America), because they are currently less involved in WIS.
            6. MDA - We must be sure to meet the requirements of the [GDPFS](https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/DPFS/Manual_GDPFS.html). There is currently work going on in data processing and it is important that WIS 2.0 meets their requirements so that they don't have to develop further.
            7. MDA - We must be sure WIS 2.0 is the answer to climate system requirements.
        - 2016-26: RGb - Provide to the Association the feedback received so far from users to TC and SC.
            1. LLG - CLOSED - RGb has provided a summary of the [feedback]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/20170314-CUSTOMER-FEATURE-REQUESTS-V01-RG.pptx)
            2. LLG - Several features have been requested, the details are in the powerpoint; for example:
                - Singapore has requested improvements in Security.
                - There are also comments that OpenWIS is not so easy to manage.
            3. MDA - I have been in contact with Moscow; they have tried to use it more, to the full solution, but it is still too complicated for them to manage alone.
            4. I have had an exchange with India, but they are lost with it.
            5. LLG - We worked with Russia in their own framework, so it is a very specific solution. Now, they want a more standard solution; we are in the early discussion stage.
            6. LLG - India is difficult to progress; they are really interested but they are looking at all the options. We will try to discuss in future. Maybe they will be joining the Association? We'll wait and see.
        - 2016-24: LLG â€“ Clarify in the communications plan.
            1. LLG - CLOSED - Apologies, not clear what was expected, so discuss later under the agenda item.
        - 2016-23: RGib - email info about who is using OpenWIS to both TC and SC.
            1. LLG - CLOSED - This is covered in the powerpoint from RGb: [feedback]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/assets/20170314-CUSTOMER-FEATURE-REQUESTS-V01-RG.pptx)
        - 2016-21: JT/PR - Work with Michael to determine legal validity in all territories of a click-through online CLA - and validity under Belgian law.  Refer to legal contact of IRM?
            1. JT - CLOSED - I discussed it with Michael, but anyway the current process doesn't use a click-thru.
        - 2016-20: JT/PR - Talk to Michael Robbins about whether an umbrella agreement would have legal standing.
            1. JT - CLOSED - The assumption is that one umbrella agreement covers all contributors from an organisation, as stated in Annex A to the Internal Rules:
            > 'You' (or 'Your') shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the OpenWIS Association AISBL. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

            2. JT - So basically, an organisation is a single contributor.
        - 2016-19: RGr - Investigate appetite for a project proposal with DWD.
            1. RGr - CLOSED - This was in relation to AFD. I exchanged a couple of emails. It's the tool we're using in the cloud-project. Should I continue? Last year we approved multiple projects in principle.
        - 2016-18: MDA - Find out if NMS Canada is interested in bringing MetPX under the OpenWIS umbrella.
            1. MDA - CLOSED - I discussed MetPX with Michel Jean. I also discussed Canada as Associate Partner. The discussions stopped because there is a new CIO in Canada. But they are happy to put MetPX in.
        - 2016-17: WQ - To do a project proposal relating an investigation work package for the OpenWIS Core.
            1. WQ - CLOSED - Done nothing apart from what we did in OpenWIS development. (Will be covered by v5 PoC later)
        - 2016-16: JT - Clarify articles that may appear to force other people to pay for your project.
            1. JT - CLOSED - If you recall last year's discussion, we were talking about the meaning of the **equal contributions** clauses, Articles 10.2 and 10.3. These clauses are about finances for running the Association, not for running projects. We can use these contributions to provide tools, but not to cover costs of software development for a project. So, we can cover the costs of Association websites, repositories etc.
            2. JT - The SC must make a budget recommendation to the Board for approval, so we have mechanisms in place to ensure sensible decisions are made about what Association contributions are spent on.
            3. MDA - But how can I be sure that MF is not obliged to contribute to a project it is not interested in?
            4. JT - Because there is _no_ obligation. I will update the Internal Rules to clarify this, by Friday. I will summarise my proposed changes when we cover new projects.
            5. MDA - The action was to check.
            6. JT - Yes and the only binding thing is equal contributions to the Association, which the Board have to approve anyway.
        - 2016-15: WQ(TC) - Define the roles in the development process - see JT doc.
            1. WQ - CLOSED - This was discussed at the Developer Conference and documented since. We discussed it further during the TC.
            2. JT - Ok, we should update the Technical Rules to clarify the roles now used in the development process.
                - SO - [Action-SC-2017-01 Update Technical Rules to clarify roles](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/172)
        - 2016-14: PR - RISK for Board Risk Register - That the articles of the Association are not fit for purpose regarding, particularly:
            - Article 14.1 Architecture role of TC,
            - Article 9.1 No mention of contributors,
            - Article 21.2 Indemnity of partners and contributors.
            1. JT - Ok, so we keep this open until we have a Board Risk Register.
                - PR - [Action-SC-2016-14 Add new risks to Risk Register](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/170)
        - 2016-13: JT (through Michael Robbins) get legal advice on whether the articles shelter the contributors from litigation.
            1. JT - I did discuss this with Michael but I don't recall the conclusion. Article 21.2 does say 'that no _member_ can be held personally liable', but it doesn't mention _partners_ and _contributors_. Need to bottom that out and add to Risk register. May need to update the Articles.
                - JT - [Action-SC-2016-13 Seek legal advice on shelter from litigation](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/171)
        - 2016-12: JT - Make sure the role of User is clear in the internal rules.
            1. JT - CLOSED - I've been through the Internal Rules and Articles; there is no mention of _User(s)_.
            2. JT - So when we update the Technical Rules, the _User_ role should be defined.
                - SO - [Action-SC-2017-02 Update Technical Rules to define 'User'](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/173)
        - 2016-08: MDA/JT will award Leon a certificate as formal recognition of his contribution.
            1. MDA - CLOSED - Apologies, this slipped out of my mind.
            2. WQ - We cannot accept a financial reward. I did mention that the SC and Board were appreciative.
            3. MDA - In WMO you have this celebration where outstanding work is rewarded.
        - 2016-04: WQ - TC to agree lifecycle patching strategy.
            1. WQ - We addressed this to some extent in Seoul. Did we cover it with the even/odd Release number?
            2. JT - No, the patch is the 3rd digit, for example 3.14.**8**. When we talk about the TC work plan we need to say how we will respond to security issues and do a patch release. SO, is that sufficient?
            3. SO - Yes, that makes sense.
            4. WQ - CLOSED - Ok, yes, we did have a patch release, 3.14.6, for the XSS vulnerability. That is the patching strategy.
        - 2016-03: WQ â€“ TC to define 'patchable'.
            1. PR - CLOSED - Originally this meant in Goal/Metric 1.2
            2. KS - We need to be able to patch Java etc.; it's a big concern for us.
            3. JT - Do you want a change to the Technical Rules? Ask your Security folks what they mean by _patchable_ and then add that to the rules.
                - SO - [Action-SC-2017-03 Define 'patchable'](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/174)
        - 2016-02: WQ â€“ Define 'good test coverage' as a percentage (with TC).
            1. WQ - Does this mean in our own code?
            2. JT - Yes, move away from a subjective definition of 'good' to something measureable. So put objective metrics of test coverage in the Technical Rules. We have improved, but there is always room for further improvement, so we just need a guideline.
                - SO - [Action-SC-2017-04 Add test coverage metrics to Technical Rules](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/175)
            3. LLG - I don't know if we have a pragmatic software quality statement.
            4. SO - We need to identify that, we don't have it now.
            5. JT - So, we need a good objective definition of software quality.
            6. WQ - We got the current software from AKKA, but now we could put the quality rules in place at the start. So now we are suggesting we put something explicit in the Technical Rules.
                - SO - [Action-SC-2017-05 Add software quality statement to Technical Rules](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/176)
            7. JT - Do SC want to approve or review the software quality statements or are we content to let the TC handle it?
            8. LLG - It should be light-weight, although it is very technical. A general overview approved by SC perhaps?
            9. WQ - Do the Technical Rules have the same authority as the Internal Rules?
            10. JT - Internal Rule 11 talks about Technical Rules. It says the TC shall make Technical Rules, it doesn't say the SC approves them.
            11. MDA - I think that's right; SC only needs to be aware of the changes.
            12. JT - Would be nice if the TC report back on progress with the Technical Rules and objective measures definitions.
                - SO - [Action-SC-2017-06 Report to SC on quality measures](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/177)
6. **Election of chairperson ("SC Chair") and vice-chairperson ("SC Vice-Chair") of the Steering Committee (see Article A13.5)**
	  1. JT â€“ I have nominated myself as SC Chair for a further term. Are there any other nominations?
    2. JT - Hearing none.
    3. JT - Nominations for SC Vice-Chair?
    4. LLG - RGr, do you wish to be SC Vice-Chair?
    5. RGr - Yes.
    6. MDA - Ok, I thank LLG for the great job he has done for us as SC Vice-Chair. I now nominate RGr as Vice-Chair.
    7. JT - Vice-Chair needs to be one of the delegates, so RGr would replace MDA as SC delegate; Ok?
    8. MDA - Ok.
    9. JT - It comes into force 30 days later, so MDA, you are still the delegate for this meeting.
    10. JT - We also note that Sungsoo Do has replaced Okki Lee as both the TC and SC delegate for KMA (by prior email).
    11. JT - Any more nominations? Ok, hearing none, let's vote.
    12. Vote:
			1. RES-OWIS-SC-2017-01:Resolution: vote: 7-0 in favour - JT is elected as SC-Chair. OWIS-RES
			2. RES-OWIS-SC-2017-02:Resolution: vote: 7-0 in favour - RGr is elected as SC-Vice-Chair. OWIS-RES
7. **Election of chairperson ("TC-Chair") and vice-chairperson ("TC-Vice-Chair") of the Technical Committee (see Article A14.3)**
	  1. JT â€“ In terms of nominations so far, WQ has withdrawn, so thank you WQ for all your efforts and dedication as Chair of the TC for the last few years.
    2. JT - I have one nomination, for TC-Chair or TC-Vice-Chair: SO
    3. JT - Are there any other nominations?
    4. SO - I spoke to LM and he said he would stand for TC-Vice-Chair, so I nominate LM.
    5. JT - Any more nominations? Hearing none, let's vote.
    6. Vote:
			1. RES-OWIS-SC-2017-03:Resolution: vote: 7-0 in favour - SO is elected as TC-Chair. OWIS-RES
			2. RES-OWIS-SC-2017-04:Resolution: vote: 7-0 in favour - LM is elected as TC-Vice-Chair. OWIS-RES
8. **Recommendations to the Board regarding admission of new Members (see Article 6 and Internal Rule 4)**
	  1. JT - So where are we with the ECMWF partnership?
        1. BR - We have the budget. Our lawyer has returned the contract to RGr and Michael Robbins.
    2. JT - And what about Indian Met Department (IMD)?
        1. MDA - I have nothing to add to what I said before about the contact with IMD.
    3. MDA - Also, I mentioned Canada earlier.
    4. MDA - I have been in contact with the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA). They are trying to send a person to work with us at MF for 6 months, to see if they want to join for work on WIS 2.0, from July until the year end.
        1. JT - Interesting that they are identifying that new work is to be done and that OpenWIS is a place to do it.
    5. MDA - I had discussions with IMD at CBS and email exchanges since, but what they really want is someone to install the software for them. I explained that is not the role of the Association.
    6. MDA - Environment Canada discussions started last year, but I have not met the new CIO (of one or two months). Michel Jean (Director General) is willing to join but I need to meet the CIO.
    7. KS - Do we know at what level?
        1. MDA - Canada - Associate; CMA - Strategic.
    8. KS - Our experience with IMD is that we went and installed the system for them.
    9. KS - Is Canada looking for a DCPC?
        1. MDA - Yes, a DCPC.
    10. Anyone aware of any other potential new partners? Ok, none.
    11. JT - So, we need to make recommendations to the Board.
    12. JT - Last year we recommended that ECMWF be allowed to join as an Associate Partner.
        1. RGr - Michael Robbins prepared the draft contract and it was sent to ECMWF. There were a few comments from the ECMWF lawyer, but it's all legalise. {RGr referenced a CONFIDENTIAL document, not copied here}
    13. JT - OK, so there are no new recommendations for Partners.
    14. JT - Also, we are not recommending any changes from Partners to Members.
    15. JT - Ok, let's look at the ECMWF Partner Agreement.
        1. RGr - Most comments are legal, so I am unable to say whether Gregor or Michael is right.
        2. JT - Can we get Gregor and Michael to discuss online?
            - RGr - [Action-SC-2017-07 Finalise the ECMWF agreement](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/178)
        3. RGr - So, regarding the interpretation, isn't it the view of the SC that counts?
        4. BR - So, don't we just need another iteration?
        5. JT - The work plan is the Kanban board.
        6. RGr - Regarding 4.4, is the SC accepting that suggested change and change to the Internal Rules?
        7. JT - There is nothing in the Articles that says a partner can leave. So, let's amend Internal Rule 5 to make that clearer.
            - JT - [Action-SC-2017-08 Clarify that a Partner can leave](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/179)
        8. RGr - Regarding 9.1/9.2, there is a question about VAT.
            1. MDA - The annual contribution is 10k Euros; would ECMWF pay less if they had to pay tax?
            2. RGr - So the 10k Euros is without VAT?
            3. MDA - Talk to the tax expert about what tax might be due and ask about the specific ECMWF case.
                - RGr - [Action-SC-2017-09 Clarify ECMWF taxes](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/180)
            4. RGr - We also need an email from ECMWF to say that they will be paying on an annual basis.
                - BR - [Action-SC-2017-10 Formalise ECMWF payment option](https://github.com/OpenWIS/openwis-documentation/issues/181)
        9. RGr - Regarding 12.2.4?
            1. MDA - ...currently twice... Ok, escalate to the Board meeting.
        10. RGr - Regarding 19.1, that is answered by Michael.
        11. RGr - Regarding 22.2, escalate to the Board meeting.
        12. RGr - Regarding 23.2, escalate to the Board meeting.
