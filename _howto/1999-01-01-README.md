# openwis-documentation
Documentation repository for the OpenWIS Association AISBL. This project uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build HTML documentation from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The early stages of this project will concentrate on documenting the governance framework of the OpenWIS Association. More will be added as time goes on ...

For tips on writing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) see the [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To build the documentation site, we're using the `github-pages` gem from GitHub and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). More information about using Jekyll with GitHub-Pages can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). So- to build from the command-line:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

However you will probably wish to examine your changes prior to publishing them to GitHub.  To accomplish this you will need to edit "_config.yml"

```
UNCOMMENT next line before publishing to GitHub!!!  REcomment to run local tests with Jekyll serve
baseurl: "/openwis-documentation"

UNCOMMENT next line before publishing to GitHub!!!  REcomment to run local tests with Jekyll serve
url: "http://openwis.github.io"
```

Then to view the site from "http://127.0.0.1:4000"

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
