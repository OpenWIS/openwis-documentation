title: About openwis-documentation
--- 
This project uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build HTML documentation from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The early stages of this project will concentrate on documenting the governance framework of the OpenWIS Association. More will be added as time goes on ...

For tips on writing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) see the [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To build the documentation site, we're using the `github-pages` gem from GitHub and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). More information about using Jekyll with GitHub-Pages can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

More detailed information about the building of the pages can be found on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl | append: "/README.md"}}">README</a> file viewable in <a href="http://github.com/openWIS/openwis-documentation">github openWIS documentation repository</a>(or downloadable in raw [.md] form by clicking the above link).
