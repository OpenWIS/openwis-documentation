### OpenWIS4

### Purpose
To deliver the next major upgrade to the OpenWIS core software, in a form that is suitable both for release as an open source package and for operational deployments to GISCs, DCPCs and NCs around the global WIS network.

*Composition:* A description of the major sub-products to be delivered by the project, for example the major features or epics.

*Derivation:* The source products from which this product is derived, for example:

  - Existing products to be modified
  - Design specifications
  - A feasibility report
  - A project mandate

*Development skills required:* The skills required to develop the products or areas that should supply the development resources.

*Customer's quality expectations:* A description of the quality expected of the project's product and the standards and processes that will be applied to achieve that quality.  They will impact on every part of the product development and thus on time and cost.   The quality expectations are captured in discussion with the Customer and should be prioritized.

*Acceptance criteria:* A prioritized list of criteria that the project product must meet before the Customer will accept it.  That is, measurable definitions of the attributes the product must have to be acceptable to the key stakeholders, in particular, the Users and the Operations and Maintenance organisations.  For example: ease of use, ease of support, ease of maintenance, appearance, major functions, development costs, running costs, capacity, availability, reliability, security, accuracy or performance.

*Project-level quality tolerances:* Tolerances that apply to the acceptance criteria.

*Acceptance method:* The means by which acceptance will be confirmed.  May simply be a case of confirming all the project's products are approved or may involve complex handover arrangements, including any phased handover.

*Acceptance responsibilities:* Define who will be responsible for approvals and acceptance.

The Project Product Description defines what the project must do to gain acceptance; it is the 'Definition of Done' for the entire project.

#### Composition:
