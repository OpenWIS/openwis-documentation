14.1.4 Weather-on-the-Web. Phase-1 involves establishing a standardized mechanism to provide site-specific forecasts to content aggregators (e.g. Google, Bing etc.) for onward publication. Encoding (e.g. using schema.org vocabulary, see ISSUE #362) plus server and client application reference implementations. [Jeremy Tandy]. LM - Is this related to OpenWIS the software project? Seems more related to OpenWIS the association.
