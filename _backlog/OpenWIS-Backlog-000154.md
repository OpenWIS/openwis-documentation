v3.14.2 - Admin Portal Alarms page - issue with 29th Feb - Leap Year & using wrong year?! The error is returned from a SOAP message but I'm not sure what is producing the wrong date. Will require investigation and see whether the portal UI is involved in some way (i.e. requires investigation to see if it is still possible to reproduce this with the new version of GeoNetworks)
