There should (automagically) be a link in every Backlog item that takes you to the page on GitHub.com where you can edit the item and save it.

Maybe also for each post?

Maybe also a link to click to add a new post/backlog-item?

Maybe also for all other docs on the site - a link in every page footer?

As a start, let's just get the address of the file on GitHub displayed in the footer of every page.
