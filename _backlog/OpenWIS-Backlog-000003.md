Openam needs downgraded Java Version. Related to Issue #180 but focus more on making artefacts available in Cloudbees repository (i.e. OpenAM). Ticket indicates that this is the case now.
The following text was added to the **first 10** Backlog-MD files to test longer text. This document pulls together the financial operating aspects of the OpenWIS association. This is intended as a supplement to the Articles of Association and Internal Rules. In the event of any discrepancy between the intentions noted in this document, meaning and governance shall be sought from the Articles of Association then the Internal Rules over this document.

### Approvals for Contracts/Agreements
This covers all costs to be incurred by OpenWIS whether directly as the contracting party or indirectly through the Members, Strategic Partners, and Associate Partners supporting the Association. Expenditure must be approved prior to incurring.

### Invoice Administration
Invoices should be passed to the Treasurer who will ensure that sufficient approval is currently in place for the expenditure before approving the invoice for payment and proceeding with payment. Invoices shall be retained with approvals and evidence of payment (where appropriate) for accounting record purposes.

### Alternative Currencies
The operating currency of the association is Euros. In the event that expenditure is incurred in other currencies, the prevailing exchange rate shall be used to determine the Euro value of any such transaction for accounting record purposes.

### Payment Authorisation
All costs to be incurred must be authorised per above prior to payment. Authorisation for payment shall be completed in line with the requirements of the method of payment, e.g. 2 signatories. Payments processed through the bank account require dual signatory in line with best practice. The proxy holders are the president, vice president and treasurer. Any 2 from this group can complete the payment process.

### Staff Costs
There are two main ways that OpenWIS Association AISBL could incur staff costs:

- Indirectly, where the individual is employed by a member organisation
- Directly by contracting with individual itself

In the case of an indirect arrangement, an agreement should be reached as to how these costs will be reimbursed, taking into account (but not limited to) frequency and total costs to be incurred and subsequently reimbursed by OpenWIS Association AISBL. The member organisation employing the individual is responsible for ensuring that all local tax and filing requirements are met.
If the OpenWIS Association AISBL directly employs an individual, it is suggested that a local payroll bureau is engaged to ensure all local tax and filing requirements of the resident country of the individual are met. Consideration should any for any local pension, insurance or similar requirements when entering into a contract should also be noted.
