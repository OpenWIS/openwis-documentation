Improve Developer documentation, both for our own use and to attract open source collaborators. Appoint a Technical Author to convert our existing documentation 10k euros worth of effort). WQ - We want admin, user, dev docs in a consistent style, not just the web site, it is the design/style of the docs. LM - Is this just a duplicate of the one above? Estimate assumes NOT and includes rewriting existing doco in Markdown.
