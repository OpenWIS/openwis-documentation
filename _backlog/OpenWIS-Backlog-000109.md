Email Dissemination issue - embedded in body option needs to be removed. It would be worth considering the dissemination options available to user: 1. Mail: do we want to keep Embedded in body? 2. Mail: what do other's do for Header line? 3. FTP: Should passive be enabed by default? 4. FTP: Encrypt is not exposed as a parameter to the dissem. harnesses. Should we keep or remove from UI?
